# Tomas' Personal Website

This repo contains my personal website which is a fork of [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)

### Developing

- `tomas-dev` is my working branch
- `tomas` is essentially the "master" branch and requires a pull request
- `master` branch is not touched directly, instead the github action triggers a build which pushes to `master`.
